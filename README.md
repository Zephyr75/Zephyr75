### Hi there 👋
I'm Antoine, a French computer science student passionate about the science behind making games! I love experimenting with new technologies in my personal projects.

Some of my best projects include:
- 🏎️ [overdrive](https://github.com/Zephyr75/overdrive) : a work-in-progress game engine created using OpenGL and supporting a custom export format to fully integrate with Blender scenes.
- 🛰️ [road classifier](https://github.com/Zephyr75/road_classifier) : a machine learning computer vision project to identify roads from satellite images, the link will be available soon.
- ⚔️ [elysium](https://github.com/Zephyr75/elysium) : a solo-developed adventure game made with Unity about rebellion against an illegitimate dictator
- 🧠 [platformer AI](https://github.com/Zephyr75/platformerAI) : an ML project to teach an AI to play a randomly generated PyGame platformer
- 🤖 [subject 77](https://github.com/Zephyr75/OGJ_2023) : a solo-developed Game Jam game made in 24 hours for Orbital Game Jam 2023, music by jadtl
